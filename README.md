I’m Veneto, a visual artist and designer.
A Black gay man, 45+, who came to art later in life — not by lack of desire, but because survival often had to come first.

🎨 What I do

I create symbolic flat compositions in the Veneto Flat style, blending:

Brazilian folk expression, intuitive geometry, everyday spirituality, earthy, organic color palettes.

My work seeks to organize the world inside a frame — balancing color, form, rhythm, and quiet intensity.

🔭 Path so far

Art was always near me, yet life didn’t always allow me to be near art.
Coming from contexts where necessity precedes creativity, my artistic practice matured when time and breath finally opened space.
Now I turn that lived experience into visual language.

🌱 Learning...

New symbolic systems and ways to translate personal and collective stories into visual structure.

👯 Open to collaborate on...

Identity-driven projects, cultural work, editorial design, symbolic narratives.

💬 Ask me about...

Flat composition, symbolic geometry, earthy palettes, late-blooming creative journeys, and turning lived experience into imagery.

⚡ About me

I believe a strong image doesn’t demand attention — it holds it.
I aim to create pieces that stand in silence, balanced and complete.
